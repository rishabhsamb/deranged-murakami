# deranged-murakami
This is the product of learning over character sequences instead of word embeddings to try and reproduce text by Haruki Murakami. It was initially an educational project on RNNs and their implementations in modern ML framworks, but I thought the outputs of the model were funny enough to host.

## Demo
There is a small demo site setup at http://rishabhsamb.github.io/deranged-murakami. Expect about ~3 seconds of processing time for your produced text.

I personally recommend trying names, phrases, or keywords that you might see in either _Kafka on the Shore_ or _Norwegian Wood_. Examples include 'Crow', 'Kafka' 'Watanabe', or 'Naoko'. The demo only produces 200 characters on top of the provided prompt, so maybe don't try and make a novel!
